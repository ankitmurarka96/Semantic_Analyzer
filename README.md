# Semantic_Analyzer

Semantic Analysis is the third phase of Compiler. Semantic Analysis makes sure that declarations and statements of program are semantically correct. It is a collection of procedures which is called by parser as and when required by grammar. Both syntax tree of previous phase and symbol table are used to check the consistency of the given code. Type checking is an important part of semantic analysis where compiler makes sure that each operator has matching operands.
